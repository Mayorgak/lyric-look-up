># Lyric Look-Up

>## User Story
As a user with a Spotify account
I want to access lyrics for various songs
So that I can sing along to the song I am listening to.


>## Technologies Used
Javascript, HTML, Bulma-desgin




>## Usage
1. [https://mayorgak.github.io/project-1/](https://mayorgak.github.io/project-1/)
2. Our program can pull lyrics for the songs from a users currently playing Spotify track.



>## Development
Initally our idea was to take use a movie API to find the soundtrack for a searched movie and to feed in this information to a second API to display that sound track on Spotify.  Sadly that porition of an API does not exisit so we decided to have the lyrics display for a Spotify song that is currently playing.

>## Improvements for the Futre
Our hope is that we will be able to display concert information and find a better lyric API with a boarder range of lyrics.
