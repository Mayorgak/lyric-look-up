># Lyric Look-Up

>## User Story
<p>
As a user with a Spotify account
I want to access lyrics for various songs
So that I can sing along to the song I am listening to.
</p>
<br />


>## Technologies Used
<p>
Javascript, HTML, Bulma-desgin
</p>

<br />


>## Usage
<p>

Our program can pull lyrics for the songs from a users currently playing Spotify track.
</p>

<br />

>## Development
<p>
Initally our idea was to take use a movie API to find the soundtrack for a searched movie and to feed in this information to a second API to display that sound track on Spotify.  Sadly that porition of an API does not exisit so we decided to have the lyrics display for a Spotify song that is currently playing.
</p>

<br />

>## Improvements for the Futre
<p>
Our hope is that we will be able to display concert information and find a better lyric API with a boarder range of lyrics.
</p>
