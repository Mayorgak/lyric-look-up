# Lyric Look-Up

## User Story

As a user with a Spotify account
I want to access lyrics for various songs
So that I can sing along to the song I am listening to.



## Technologies Used

Javascript, HTML, Bulma-desgin


## Usage
Our program can pull lyrics for the songs from a users currently playing Spotify track.


## Development

Initally our idea was to take use a movie API to find the soundtrack for a searched movie and to feed in this information to a second API to display that sound track on Spotify.  Sadly that porition of an API does not exisit so we decided to have the lyrics display for a Spotify song that is currently playing.


## Improvements for the Futre

Our hope is that we will be able to display concert information and find a better lyric API with a boarder range of lyrics.
